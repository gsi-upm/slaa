Introduction
---------------------
SLAA agent architecture for Web-based developing of communication 
oriented agents. The implementation has been done with the Java JAIN SLEE
standard and the Drools rule engine for rule-based programming agents. The behavior of an
agent is defined by the actions done after a rule is red. The rules are triggered by the arrival
of events. These events are received at the JAIN SLEE server through resource adapters and
are typically generated by external elements but can also be generated internally. An agent
is aware of what is happening in its environment through the events received, and it can
interact with the environment via the available actions dened by the arrival of events.

## Installation

###1.System Requirements
* Ubuntu 12.10
* java version "1.7.0_17"

###2.System Configuration
Set the JBOSS_HOME environment variable to point to the directory "slaa-1.0.FINAL":

    export JBOSS_HOME=/home/fet/Desktop/slaa-1.0.FINAL

###3.Server Configuration
Set the server IP and port in the slaa-1.0.FINAL/server/default/deploy/ROOT.war/slaa/js/config.js file:

    endPoint = 'http://localhost:8080/mobicents'

###4.Running Server
Go to slaa-1.0.FINAL/bin and execute:
* ./run.sh (for local access)
* ./run.sh -b 0.0.0.0 (for local and external access)

Now you can go to a web client and try the server at localhost:8080/slaa

## Running the Example

###1.Configuring Agent
Click on [exampleUser] and then on [exampleAgent] and set the Agent Gtalk user credentials. 
Create a Gtalk account for the Agent if you don't have one.  
Go to rules editor and add and expert user in the "Started" rule. 
You can add yourself as expert user in order to test the agent:

    String[] experts = {"example@gmail.com"};
    String[] names = {"Your Name"};

###2.Configuring Agent web client
Set the configuration in the slaa-1.0.FINAL/server/default/deploy/ROOT.war/exampleAgent/js/config.js file:

    endPoint = 'http://localhost:8080/mobicents'
    userName = 'exampleUser'
    agentName = 'exampleAgent'

###3.Starting the Agent
* Add the Agent Gtalk account to the expert user Gtalk contacts list
* Click on [agents] or [exampleUser] and then on [start]. Now you must see the Agent online.  
* Go to a web client and try the agent at localhost:8080/exampleAgent.  
* Have fun!
